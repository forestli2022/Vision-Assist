# Vision Assist

This is the GitHub repo of Google Solution Challenge 2024 Vision Assist.

We have deployed the demo on Heroku (https://visionassist-c75d69ed7b0d.herokuapp.com/).

Sadly, the web application's voice synthesis is not compatible with some of the mobile browsers due to their safety restrictions, and we are aiming to fix the issue in the future.

## How to use

To enable real-time environment scanning, click on the microphone button, say "activate" or "activate scanning", and click on the microphone again. To disable, click the microphone button and say "deactivate scanning" or "deactivate".

To get navigation instructions, click on the button and say "navigate to ADDRESS", replacing ADDRESS with your destination. To disable, say "deactivate navigation" or "exit navigation".

The two functionalities can be used at the same time.
